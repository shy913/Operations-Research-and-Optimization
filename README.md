# Operations Research & Optimization

This is my homework of Operations Research & Optimization, so it may not be updated.

## Simplex Method & Simplex Table
Contains a solver to linear programming problem using simplex method while showing the simplex table. Also it can tell the nature of the solution. 
### How to use:
1. Transform the LP problem to standard form:

  Maximize $c^T x$

  Subject to {A x = b, x >= 0

  Make sure that an identity matrix must contain in AÔºÅ
  
2. Now we have A, b, c.
3. import shypy
4. Let Solution = maximize(c, A, b)
5. Solution().show()

Note that bugs may exsist! 
### Existing bugs: 
1. In some cases, especially when there're multiple solutions, the number of basic variables may be more than $m$.

## Fibonacci Search & Bisection Search
### How to use:
fib_search(f, a, b, n):
    param f: The function to be evaluated.
    param a: Left node of the interval
    param b: Right node of the interval
    param n: Total number of evaluation
    return: Final Interval
    example:
    ``` python
    def func(x):
    return x ** 2 - 6 * x + 2
fib_search(func, 0, 10, 34)
    ```
